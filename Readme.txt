Our FIRST SteamWorks robot consists of:

	A Shooter w/ Trigger Motor

	A Gear Pouch
		It will have a sensor to detect if it has a gear 

	A Climber
		Motor that sarts spinning in the last 30 seconds of the match.
	
	A Feeder Motor

The Autos are as follows:
	The Basics:
		Drive Forward, Stand Still  (Done)
	Gear Autos:
		Left, Right and Center (Done)
	Shooter Autos:
		Left and Right (Done?)
	Hopper Autos:
		Left Far, right far, left near, right near  (Done but untested)
	Shooter Hopper Autos:
		Left Hopper then shoot, Right hopper then shoot
	Gear then shoot ten:
		Left, Right
	Advanced Gears:
		Left or Right gear, then drive up towards the further hoppers in the center of the field

Basically the most effective ones will:
	drop of a gear and shoot 10 balls
	Go to the hopper, come back and shoot
	Drop of a gear, drive across the field and unload a far hopper
